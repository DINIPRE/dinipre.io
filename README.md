## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

While doing this project, I learned how to use the flexbox and how to use a few different css styles! Most importantly, i learnt how to use git.

see

```html
<span>Some HTML code I'm proud of</span>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  position: absolute;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to develop my skills by studying advanced css and dive into basic js!

### Useful resources

- [git](https://www.github.com) - This helped me to share my projects. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing study site which helped me finally understand html and css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
